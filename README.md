### Usage:

1. Run (I put the keymap as ctrl+shift+e) to bring up a quick panel of possible errors in the csv file.
2. The list of errors will be copied to clipboard
3. Select the line to go to and fix the errors
4. Running again will use the same list of errors
5. Select clear search will clear cache for a new search

### Note:
This doesn't do type checking, and should be optimized for large files.
