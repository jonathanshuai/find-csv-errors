### Usage:
1. Run (I put the keymap as ctrl+shift+e) to bring up a quick panel of possible errors in the csv file.
2. The malformed lines can be copied to a buffer (new tab)
3. Select the line to go to and examine/fix errors
4. Running again will use the same list of errors (a new search will not be performed)
5. Selecting clear search will clear cache for a new search

### Note:
1. This doesn't do type checking (probably will add this later) 
2. Probably not optimized for large files (shouldn't be opening large files in sublime??)
